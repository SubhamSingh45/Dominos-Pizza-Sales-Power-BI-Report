# 🍕 Domino's Pizza Sales Report (SQL + Power BI)

This is a Power BI report analyzing Domino’s Pizza sales from January to December 2015. Data was extracted and processed using SQL and visualized in Power BI to uncover trends, top-performing items, and order behaviors.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Domino's wanted to improve its sales performance by understanding:

- Which pizza categories and sizes generate the most revenue
- When customers are most likely to place orders (day/month)
- Which menu items are underperforming and could be removed or promoted
- How to optimize order value and pizza combinations

## 💡 Solution

A Power BI Report was built using sales data from January to December 2015. SQL was used to clean and structure the data, and Power BI was used to visualize it.

This report helps the business:

- Identify best-selling and worst-selling pizzas by revenue, quantity, and order count
- Spot busiest order days/times to optimize staffing and delivery operations
- Track monthly order trends to adjust marketing and promotions
- Focus more on profitable pizza categories (e.g., Classic and Large size)
